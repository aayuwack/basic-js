This code creates a styled ID card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let’s break it down step by step:

 1. *HTML Structure*:
   - *DOCTYPE and Basic Structure*: 
     - The <!DOCTYPE html> tag specifies the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
     - The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page, with a lang="en" attribute indicating the language is English.
     - The <head> section contains metadata, including character encoding, viewport settings for responsive design, the page title, and links to external stylesheets like Bootstrap for additional styling.
   - *ID Card Layout*:
     - Inside the <body>, a div with class container is used to center the content on the page.
     - The ID card itself is a div with the class id-card. It includes:
       - An img tag to display the user's profile picture.
       - A div with class name for the ID card title.
       - A div with class details, containing label and input pairs to display the user's name, ID, contact information, and address.

 2. *CSS Styling*:
   - *General Styles*:
     - The ID card has a fixed width of 300px and padding for spacing. 
     - The border-radius adds rounded corners, and the box-shadow gives a subtle 3D effect with a shadow.
     - The background color is set to white, with the text centered for a neat appearance.
   - *Image Styling*:
     - The image width is set to 100% to fit the container, and the height is fixed at 250px. The border-radius creates rounded corners for the image.
     - object-fit: cover; ensures the image maintains its aspect ratio while covering the entire area.
   - *Text Styling*:
     - The .name class centers the text and gives it a bold, blue appearance.
     - The .details class styles the input fields, giving them a bold, italic look with black text color.

  3. *JavaScript*:
   - *DOM Manipulation*:
     - JavaScript is used to populate the ID card with dynamic content once the page loads.
     - The script listens for the DOMContentLoaded event, ensuring the code runs after the HTML content is fully loaded.
     - A per object contains user details like name, id, contact, and address.
     - The script selects the appropriate DOM elements by their IDs (e.g., name, id, contact, address) and sets their value attributes to the corresponding properties from the per object.
     - The profileImage.src is also set dynamically to display the user's profile picture.

  4. *External Libraries*:
   - *Bootstrap*: 
     - Bootstrap is included for responsive design and built-in styles.
     - It’s linked via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) in the <head> section, which provides CSS and JS files.
   - *jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS*:
     - These libraries are included for additional JavaScript functionality. While they aren't directly used in your code, they could be useful for future enhancements.
